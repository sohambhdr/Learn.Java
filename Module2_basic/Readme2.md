Module 2: Basics of Java

Java - What, Where and Why?
Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language. It's used for web apps (e.g., servers), mobile apps (Android), desktop software, games, and big data. Why? It's versatile, secure, and has a huge community.

Internals of Java Program
A Java program is compiled into bytecode (.class files) by the compiler. The JVM interprets this bytecode to run on the machine.

Difference between JDK, JRE and JVM
JDK (Java Development Kit): Tools to develop Java (compiler, debugger). Includes JRE.
JRE (Java Runtime Environment): Runs Java programs (includes JVM).
JVM (Java Virtual Machine): Executes bytecode, manages memory.

Internal Details of JVM
JVM has:
1. Class Loader: Loads classes.
2. Memory Areas: Heap (objects), Stack (methods), etc.
3. Execution Engine: Interprets/compiles bytecode.
4. Garbage Collector: Frees unused memory.

Variable Details of JVM
Variables in JVM are stored in stack or heap. Local variables on stack, instance variables on heap.

Variable and Data Type
Variables store data. Data types define what kind (e.g., int for numbers).
1. Primitive types: int, float, double, char, boolean, byte, short, long.
2. Reference types: Objects like String.

Unicode System
Java uses Unicode (UTF-16) for characters, supporting global languages (e.g., emojis, non-English text).
