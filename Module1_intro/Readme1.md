Module 1: Introduction to Java

Introduction to OOPS
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of programming that organizes code around "objects" rather than just functions or procedures. Think of objects as real-world things like a car or a person â€“ they have properties (like color) and behaviors (like driving).

Object-Oriented Programming System
OOPS (often written as OOP) stands for Object-Oriented Programming. It's a paradigm that uses classes and objects to structure code, making it reusable and easier to manage.

Benefits of OOPS
1. Reusability: Write code once and use it multiple times (e.g., via inheritance).
2. Modularity: Break code into smaller, independent parts.
3. Security: Hide internal details (encapsulation).
4. Easier Maintenance: Changes in one part don't affect others much.
5. Real-World Modeling: Code mimics real life, making it intuitive.

Java History
Java was created by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems in 1995. It was originally called Oak, then Green, and finally Java. Oracle acquired Sun in 2010. Java's motto is "Write Once, Run Anywhere" because it runs on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

Java Language Features
1. Platform Independent: Compiles to bytecode that runs on JVM.
2. Simple: No pointers, automatic memory management.
3. Secure: Runs in a sandbox.
4. Robust: Handles errors well.
5. ultithreaded: Supports concurrent tasks.
6. High Performance: Just-in-time compilation.
