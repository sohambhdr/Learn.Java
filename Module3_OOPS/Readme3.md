Object and Class
1. Class: Blueprint (e.g., a recipe for a cake).
2. Object: Instance of a class (e.g., an actual cake).
See Main.java file 

Method Overloading
Same method name, different parameters (e.g., add(int, int) vs. add(double, double)).
See Main1.java 

Constructor
Special method to initialize objects. Same name as class, no return type.
See Main2.java

Static variable, method, and block
1. Static: Belongs to class, not object. Shared across instances.
2. Static block: Runs when class loads.
See Main3.java

Inheritance (IS-A)
Child class inherits from parent (e.g., Dog IS-A Animal).
See Main4.java

Aggregation and Composition (HAS-A)
1. Aggregation: Loose relationship (e.g., Car has Engine, but Engine can exist alone).
2. Composition: Strong (e.g., Car has Wheels; Wheels don't exist without Car).
See Main5.java

Method Overriding
Child class redefines parent's method.
See Main6.java

Super keyword
Refers to parent class. Used for variables, methods, constructors.
See Main7.java

Instance Initializer block
Runs every time an object is created, before constructor.
See Main8.java

Final keyword
1. Final variable: Constant.
2. Final method: Can't be overridden.
3. Final class: Can't be inherited.
See Main9.java

Runtime Polymorphism
Method call decided at runtime (via overriding).

See Method Overriding example above.

Static and Dynamic binding
1. Static: Resolved at compile time (e.g., static methods).
2. Dynamic: At runtime (overridden methods).
Abstract class and Interface
1. Abstract class: Can't instantiate, has abstract methods.
2. Interface: 100% abstract, defines contracts.
See Main10.java for Abstract Class and Main11.java for Interface


Package and Access Modifiers
1. Package: Group classes (e.g., package com.example;).
2. Access Modifiers: public (anywhere), protected (subclass/package), default (package), private (class).
Use import to access other packages.


Encapsulation
Binding data and methods, hiding internals (use private variables, public getters/setters).
See Main12.java

Object Class
Base class for all Java classes. Has methods like equals(), hashCode(), toString().
See Main13.java


Java Array : See Main14.java
